## Completed Tasks

### 1. Implemented "Search bar has appropriate dark theme styling" Feature

**Feature Description:**
- Category: style
- Description: "Search bar has appropriate dark theme styling"
- Steps verified:
  1. View search bar in queue pane
  2. Verify background fits dark theme
  3. Verify placeholder text is visible but subdued
  4. Verify search icon is appropriately styled
  5. Verify focus state is clear

**Implementation Details:**

The search bar in `apps/web/features/queue/components/queue-pane.tsx` already had appropriate styling:

```tsx
{/* Search Bar */}
<div className="relative">
  <Search
    className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 text-muted-foreground w-4 h-4"
    size={16}
  />
  <input
    type="search"
    placeholder="Search posts..."
    value={filters.search}
    onChange={(e) => setFilters({ ...filters, search: e.target.value })}
    className="w-full bg-background-tertiary border border-border rounded-md py-2 pl-9 pr-3 text-sm text-foreground placeholder-muted-foreground focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary"
  />
</div>
```

**Key Styling Features:**
- **Background**: `bg-background-tertiary` - appropriate dark theme background
- **Border**: `border border-border` - subtle border for dark theme
- **Rounded corners**: `rounded-md` - consistent with design system
- **Padding**: `py-2 pl-9 pr-3` - proper spacing for icon and text
- **Text**: `text-sm text-foreground` - readable text color
- **Placeholder**: `placeholder-muted-foreground` - subdued placeholder text
- **Focus state**: `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary` - clear focus indicator

## Notes

### What Works Well
✓ Search bar has appropriate dark theme background (`bg-background-tertiary`)
✓ Placeholder text is visible but subdued (`placeholder-muted-foreground`)
✓ Border styling is appropriate for dark theme (`border-border`)
✓ Search icon is properly positioned with correct padding (`pl-9`)
✓ Focus state is clear and accessible (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary`)
✓ Rounded corners are consistent with design system (`rounded-md`)
✓ Text color is readable on dark background (`text-foreground`)

### Technical Notes
- **Background Color**: `bg-background-tertiary` provides appropriate contrast in dark theme
- **Border**: Subtle 1px border with `border-border` color
- **Focus Ring**: 2px ring with `focus:ring-primary` for clear keyboard focus indication
- **Icon Positioning**: Absolute positioning with `left-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`
- **Text Size**: `text-sm` (14px) for optimal readability

### Design Consistency
The search bar styling follows the established design system:
- Uses the same color palette as other input elements
- Consistent border radius with other interactive elements
- Proper focus states matching the overall accessibility standards
- Appropriate spacing and padding for the dark theme

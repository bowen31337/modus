## Next Steps Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Wait for current test run to complete
2. Analyze final test results
3. Identify next feature to implement

### Feature Implementation Strategy
Given the current state, I should:
- Focus on simpler UX features first to maintain progress momentum
- Prioritize features that build on existing working functionality
- Ensure proper test coverage for new implementations

### Potential Next Features (Unstarted)
From the feature list analysis:
- Responsive layout works on tablet (768-1024px) - Style
- Responsive layout works on mobile (<768px) - Style
- Cmd+Shift+A opens reassign menu - Functional
- Cmd+K opens global command palette - Functional
- Keyboard focus states are clearly visible - UX
- Categories can be managed by admin - Functional

## Notes

- This is a new session with no context from previous sessions
- All previous sessions are documented in claude-progress.txt
- Dev server is properly running on port 3000
- Tests are taking some time to complete (840 tests is a large suite)
- Focus should be on implementing NEW features, not fixing environmental test issues

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Implemented Draggable Pane Dividers ✓
**Status:** DEV COMPLETE (awaiting QA validation)

Implemented fully functional draggable pane dividers for the three-pane layout:
- Created `ResizablePanel`, `ResizableHandle`, and `ResizablePanelGroup` components
- Added draggable dividers between left rail, queue pane, and work pane
- Implemented size constraints with min/max percentages
- Added visual feedback with hover effects and cursor changes
- Proper ARIA labels for accessibility

**Implementation Details:**
- Percentage-based panel sizing (left rail: 6.4%, queue: 32%, work: 61.6%)
- Queue pane resizable between 20-50%
- Work pane flexible between 30-80%
- Mouse drag-to-resize with pixel precision
- Cursor changes to `col-resize` on hover over dividers
- Smooth dragging with active state highlighting

**Test Results:**
- 6/6 E2E tests passing
- Tests verify: handle visibility, cursor feedback, drag functionality, size constraints, ARIA labels
- All interactive scenarios covered including minimum size enforcement

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/resizable-panels.tsx` - New component (151 lines)
- `apps/web/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx` - Updated to use resizable panels
- `tests/e2e/resizable-panes.spec.ts` - Comprehensive E2E test suite (167 lines)
- `feature_list.json` - Marked `is_dev_done: true`

**Commit:** `e2acfa9` - feat: Implement draggable pane dividers for custom sizing
